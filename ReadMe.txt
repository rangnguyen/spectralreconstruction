
I. USAGE

     1. To test the GFC and RMSE of spectral reflectance reconstruction, 
        please use the 'run.m' file and use images in folder 'code_upload\
        data\testing\sample_20000\' to save the time.

     2. To see RGB image and reconstruct spectral information for a 
        whole image, please use the 'mainGUI.m' file and open image in
        the folder 'database_upload\testing\mat_norm\'. This folder contains
        full-size images.

Make sure your computer has enough RAM (at least 16GB) and MATLAB 2013a version.
